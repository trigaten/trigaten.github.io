# SMC Data Challenge
- title: SMC Data Challenge
  description:
    I worked with a team of undergrads to develop a semantic segmentation model for 
    the "<a href="https://smc-datachallenge.ornl.gov/2021-challenge-3/">Synthetic-to-Real Domain Adaptation for Autonomous Driving<a>" challenge. This was a good DL
    learning experience and our paper was accepted into the SMC Data Challenge 2021, but our results 
    were realistically below industry standard.

    A backend/business logic codebase of PHP functions for my highschool 'natural plant teaching gardens'
