            <p>TRS is an end-to-end data collection and analysis system which allows college
                counselors at high schools to collect preference data
                from students and teachers on who they want to write their college recommendation
                letter and who they want to write for respectively.</p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col twoColumns">
            <p>The current system of assigning students to teacher recommenders often consists of
                students finding teachers, asking them to be their recommender, then the student
                reporting this to the college counselors. This system leads to a number of issues
                including, but not limited to: teachers getting overwhelmed with students for whom
                to write, students taking weeks to locate their teachers and report to their counselors,
                suboptimal groupings being formed where teachers might feel that they must write for students
                with whom they don't have much experience, and finally general disorganization.

                After considering a number of platforms to build on, I decided that
                the Google Workspace development environment was optimal for this project.
                I didn't have to worry about security, sign in, or servers. Additionally, 
                most users would be using a platform which was already familiar to them and installing the
                add-on is easy.
            </p>
            <p>I built a Google Sheet Add-On with a Sidebar menu which provides buttons to execute 
                different functionality. After certain steps, reports are generated as Google Sheets.
